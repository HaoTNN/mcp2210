MCP2210 C Driver
====================

## Summary
This is a driver written in C for Linux for Microchip's USB-to-SPI bridge <a href="http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?product=MCP2210">MCP2210</a>.

There are other drivers available on GitHub, so why write another? The main motivation for me was to understand more about the inner workigns of the
Linux kernel and how drivers work.
